The Gauntlett Webserver

This program aims to create a simple, universal, webserver application which can maintain, create, and load any type of website from predefined functions using a list of directories, one for each website, eachw tih it's own database and each page with it's own table

The site requires the sites_available file in /config to contain a list of all domains the site will run on, please add all domains plus extension, exp: example.com
not www.example.com, the name and extension only

after setting that up you may pick a website as your main and log into that, however it doesn't matter which one you choose as your default, simply visit example.com/admin
once there please create a new user, the higher the permissions the better, 5 is webmaster and can create new websites, webpages, and administrators for each website, however no one can administer more than one website, including the webmaster, for security purposes.

new files may be uploaded with the next function, this allows you to upload images, videos, webpages, css files, anything you desire, files are sorted and placed into thier appropriate folder, non-executable files such as images and zips, will be stored in the static directory, style sheets may also be found here

directories are as follows:

serverroot/example.com/pages/page.html
serverroot/example.com/static/style/page.css
serverroot/example.com/static/images/image.png

I am currently working on the 404 page and additional file formats for serving, currently only html will serve, this requires an adjustment in the get method
